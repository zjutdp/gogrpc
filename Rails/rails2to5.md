# Major changes from Rails 2 to 5
* Consolidate all the bin/* to rails from 3, and proxy Rake tasks through bin/rails too in 5
* Merge Rails API into core, make it possible to use Rails for API only backend services for modern SPA frameworks like Angular/React/Vue
* Decouple Active Model from Active Record, make Any Ruby Object Feel Like ActiveRecord, which is awesome
* Rspec seems still the most popular testing framework for Ruby and Rails apps
* Introduce the DCI impl concerns directory, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541823/how-to-use-concerns-in-rails-4
